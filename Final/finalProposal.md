## Idea/Concept
Create a gameified version of my physical computing project. It would be a jousting game with two characters opposite each other. And using a physical interface, you can control one character's movement using potentiometers as well as fire bullets (or shoot something, not sure about this part yet) using a button, the bullet might utilize GSAP animation but that is unclear at this point. There will be an interface on the screen that keeps track of the score as well as have the capability to restart the game at any point. I will create a theme for the game, my intention is to take a very dadaist approach to theming/aesthetics, particularly with the characters and the background setting.

## Inspiration and Challenges
I was primarily inspired by the Joust arcade game in terms of mechanics and controls as well as the general concept of characters jousting.

Where my project would differ is that I want to have a bullet firing mechanic incorporated into the game as well. I also don't think I will have any computer generated enemies. (unless I have extra time, I feel that this aspect would take a lot of time to figure out and it's not necessarily worth it). I also am debating expanding the area of game play to include multiple levels in the Y-direction for added difficulty and interactivity. 

It will be a challenge to determine the best physical interface for movement and firing bullets. At present I think I will use two potentiometers for controlling movement in the x and y direction respectively and designate a button for firing bullets of some kind. 

## Schedule
I think creating the physical interface will be the first thing I tackle because I am still the least familiar with Arduino and physical computing. Next I will design my characters using 3D modeling software, Maya. Then I will create the platforms and setting for the game. Then I will start to design the player mechanics as well as create the bullets that the characters fire. After that I will add polish and juice effects to make the overall presentation more appealing. 
Week 1: Physical inteface design + begin 3D models 
Week 2: Finish 3D Models + Create setting/background elements in three.js + Create score system/display
Week 3: Import models and design player mechanics + connect physical interface to electron + add polish and juice effects
